Inform 7 language grammar for Atom
Created by Andrew Plotkin <erkyrath@eblong.com>

This started as a fork of [Robert Clarke's Inform grammar][kumo]. It's turned into a total rewrite, though. I've renamed it to include the "7" (since Inform 6 is a different language) and added "7" to all the syntax classes.

[kumo]: https://github.com/kumo/language-inform

This correctly colors:

- Strings with bracketed substitutions
- Nested comments
- Header lines
- Inform 6 inclusions (with I6 strings and comments)
- The documentation section at the end of an I7 extension
